# People-Email-Unique-Character-Counter-inator

This web application leverages the SalesLoft API to return a list of people
organized beautifully into a table. Once the data is displayed, you'll have
the option to click the "Toggle Uniquify" button which will render yet another beautiful table that sorts the counts of the unique characters inside of each person's email address. Click the button again to go back to the list of people.

## Tech Used

React JS was used for the logic and component rendering in conjunction with Custom CSS to style these intricate componenents. Jest was used to create the testing suites for this app, simply run `npm test` after cloning to run a watcher for the tests.
